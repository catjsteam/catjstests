# jQuery TodoMVC Example Tested with CatJS

The original TodoMVC JQuery example with CatJS tests built-in. Currently test added:
* Insert a new Todo item
* Delete a Todo item

For Installation CatJS installation guide visit: https://www.npmjs.com/package/catjs  

CatJS test audit: 
* **./cat-project** catjs project added
* **./cat-project/catproject.json** catjs tool project file 
* **./index.html** import catjs library annotation added 
* **./js/app.js** Two annotation for calling the insert and delete tests
* **./cat-project/src/common/tests.js** The tests implementations, using catjs and chaijs API 
* **./cat-project/src/config/cat.json** The tests configuration where the scenarios and other settings exists
  
CatJS, try me:
* Installing catjs, (in short "npm install -g catjs")
* From the command-line Go to cat-project folder
* Run: (sudo) catcli -cbas
* Go to the browser and put the address: http://localhost:8080
